## LookInnaBook
LookInnaBook is a book store application. Users can register to gain access to the bookstore. Normal users can search, add books to their cart, and place orders. Admins can access additional options. These options include the ability to add and remove books, users, and publishers. They also include the ability to edit a user's order status, the user's information itself, or a book's information. Additionally, they can also generate and view sales reports.
