# COMP3005
Created for the COMP 3005 course at Carleton University. Winter 2020.

## Possible TODOs
- Might want an "Apply Filter" button to sort results
- ReportPanel
- After checkout, the system should check the stock of a book to see if more should be ordered adn print a message to the terminal saying "Emailing *publisher* to order # of new books"; probably need to implement report screen first
- ToolTipText
- Make it possible for the user to "copy and paste" order confirmation label (so they can copy their order number), might need JTextPane instead of JLabel
- Add an edit order screen to update order status only
- Fix the centering on the error label for the lookup order screen.
